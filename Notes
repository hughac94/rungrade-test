Areas for Improvement
Memory Management:

ðŸš¨ All files in memory: Loading 100 GPX files simultaneously will cause high memory usage
ðŸ”§ Solution: Process in batches of 10-20 files, then aggregate results
Coefficient Duplication:


ðŸš¨ Sequential processing: Files are processed one-by-one
ðŸ”§ Solution: Use worker threads (Node.js) to parallelize file processing
User Experience:

ðŸš¨ No real-time progress: Users must wait for all processing to complete
ðŸ”§ Solution: Stream partial results back to frontend using WebSockets
Request Timeout Risk:

ðŸš¨ Long-running requests: Processing 100 files may exceed default timeout limits
ðŸ”§ Solution: Implement file batching or increase server timeout settings
